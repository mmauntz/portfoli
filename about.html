     <h1>Introduction</h1>
     <p>I am a 24 year old Scots/German descent, and am not often mistaken for much else. I’m personally more of an introvert and try to remain humble with gratitude toward all. These days I am studying at San Jose State University for my BA in Studio Art with a minor in Biology. I transferred to SJSU from West Valley Community College in Saratoga. While I was studying at West Valley I created with my hands and took many classes on drawing, painting, 2D and 3D art. I also took a few electives in Philosophy and English which are some of my other passions. A poem I wrote is in one of the videos in my portfolio. </p>
     <p>My work is mostly paintings and drawings, although I plan to learn more digital media. I feel like my tools are an extension of myself and I love the unexpected turns and happy accidents that paint has always provided. It is a playful experience which comes through in my work as it tends to capture and animate subjects (especially inanimate ones).  .</p>
     <p>I am always trying to challenge myself and experiment in areas that I’m less comfortable with whether that being watercolor textures or taking programming classes. However, I tend towards organic subjects as nature is always surprising and amazing to me. When I create a piece of art, I want to pull a person from their knotted thoughts and feelings and forget themselves for a moment, just like a real landscape or a vast sky of stars. </p>
     <p>I love to collaborate with others and harmonize our talents and work on projects which expand both of our skills and enjoyment. I can be very meticulous to get things just right and am always willing to take things to the next level. I can also work alone greatly as well and am always teaching myself when left to it. </p>
